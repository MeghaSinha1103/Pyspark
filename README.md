# Use of Pyspark and hadoop for classification model and collaborative filtering
This project aims at using the Million playlist dataset by Spotify to build a song recommender system using collaborative filtering model 
ALS. Also, I have used classification models such as random forest, logistic regression and gradient boost models and made comparison 
for the classification of the generes of the songs.
